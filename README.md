Implementing WordPress Website with LVM Storage Management on AWS EC2 Ubuntu

A typical 3-tier architecture (3TA) consists of:
- Presentation tier
- Application tier
- Data tier

Simplified outline of a 3TA:

We will be focusing on the Application and Data tiers as thats where our DevOps skills are more emphasised. The presentation tier is more web design focused. 
So, our project will be to:
  1. Data tier: Setup of storage of for both Web and Databse servers
  2. Application tier: WordPress installation onto a Webserver and connected to a MySQL database server
