Implementing WordPress Website with LVM Storage Management on AWS EC2 Ubuntu

A typical 3-tier architecture (3TA) consists of:
- Presentation tier: What you see and interact with in your web browser or application
- Application tier: Backend of the application/website that processes all the input/outputs and any other computational requirements
- Data tier: Data storage and data access

Simplified outline of a 3TA:

We will be focusing on the Application and Data tiers as thats where our DevOps skills are more emphasised. The presentation tier is more web design focused. 
So, our project will be to:
  1. Data tier: Setup of storage of for both Web and Databse servers
  2. Application tier: WordPress installation onto a Webserver and connected to a MySQL database server
